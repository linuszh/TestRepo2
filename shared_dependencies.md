As we are generating a single file named "openai_api.py", there are no shared dependencies between multiple files. However, within the "openai_api.py" file, we will have the following:

1. API Key: The OpenAI API key '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' will be used to authenticate the API calls.

2. Function Names: We will have functions like 'setup_openai', 'generate_summary' etc. to setup the API and generate summaries respectively.

3. Message Names: The API responses will be stored in variables like 'response_message' or 'summary_message'.

4. Data Schemas: The request and response data schemas for the OpenAI API will be used. The request schema will include parameters like 'prompt', 'max_tokens' etc. and the response schema will include fields like 'id', 'object', 'created', 'model', 'choices' etc.

Please note that these are assumptions based on typical usage of the OpenAI API and the actual names may vary based on the specific requirements of the application.
